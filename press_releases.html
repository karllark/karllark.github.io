							 <h2>Galaxy Exposes its Dusty Inner Workings in New Spitzer Image</h2>
							 <p>The Small Magellanic Cloud was imaged with Spitzer using the IRAC and MIPS cameras as part of the SAGE-SMC
							 Legacy Program.   The Small Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy to our own Galaxy and can be seen with the
							 naked eye from the southern hemisphere.  This color image includes data from 3.6 to 160 microns giving the full
							 infrared view of this galaxy in one image.  The SAGE-SMC program is carried out by a large international team
							 of astronomers that are
							 concentrating on studying the interstellar medium, star formation, and evolved stars in this neat, nearby galaxy.

							 <h2>Aromatics in the Pinwheel Galaxy</h2>
							 <p>The Pinwheel Galaxy (also known as M101) was imaged by Spitzer using the IRAC and MIPS cameras.  The 3 color image
							 shows an greenish interior surrounded by a red rim.  These colors are due to the suppression of the aromatic features
							 (possibly due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs which are organic molecules) in
							 the harsh radiation fields in the outer regions of this galaxy.  This interpretation was the result of these images as
							 well as IRS spectroscopy of selected regions in this galaxy.  The full details can be found in this
							 <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...682..336G/abstract">paper</a>.  This work generated a

							 (EROs).  I lead the team which took the MIPS observations.  M81 is a SINGS Legacy galaxy and
							 the SINGS team graciously allowed these observations to be taken before and in addition to
							 the scheduled SINGS observations to show off the capabilities of Spitzer.  These observations resulted
							 a multiple papers, including <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJS..154..215G/abstract">Gordon et al. (2004)</a>.</p>

							 <p>The combined IRAC/MIPS color image of M81 has shown up in interesting places, including the cover
							 of an astronomy textbook and a video version of the Monte Python song!</p>

							 <p>The M81 images were also used in a
